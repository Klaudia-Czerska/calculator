# WINDOWS CALCULATOR
This is a first working version of calculator. I have done it to challenge myself - no lines of code were copied from tutorial.
I have tried to make it resemble the Windows calculator app, as you can see it needs a little bit of work to be 1:1, but it is just a start.

TECHNOLOGIES I USED:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
I am thinking of redoing the whole app at this point with Bootstrap.

TO ADD:
1. Memory
2. Dark mode
3. Menu
4. Scientific version
5. Graphic version
6. Programmers version
7. Date calculator
8. Converters

CREDTIS:
1. Windows calculator ;)
2. Fontawesome icons (They don't have every calculator icon, I had to drew some myself)
