# WINDOWS CALCULATOR
This is a first working version of calculator. It has A LOT of bugs. I have done it to challenge myself - no lines of code were copied from tutorial.
I have tried to make it resemble the Windows calculator app, as you can see it needs a little bit of work to be 1:1, but it is just a start.

TECHNOLOGIES I USED:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

I am thinking of redoing the whole app at this point with Bootstrap.

KNOWN BUGS:
1. Digits overflow
2. Percentage, dividing one, square and square root are not working properly with the result of operation
3. Dot is not working properly with 0 after using clear button on the result of operation
4. Operations are not working properly after using buttons dividing one, square and square root with 0
5. Equals button sometimes is not bringing the value of current calculations to calculations place - I have to check when is it happening
6. Backspace should not work on results of operation, it should just delete the calculations
7. Float imprecision
8. History should have most recent operations on top, it is backwards right now

TO DO:
1. Memory
2. Dark mode
3. Menu
4. Scientific version
5. Graphic version
6. Programmers version
7. Date calculator
8. Converters

CREDTIS:
1. Windows calculator ;)
2. Fontawesome icons (They don't have every calculator icon, I had to drew some myself)
