# WINDOWS CALCULATOR
This is a first working version of calculator. It has some bugs. I have done it to challenge myself - no lines of code were copied from tutorial.
I have tried to make it resemble the Windows calculator app, as you can see it needs a little bit of work to be 1:1, but it is just a start.

TECHNOLOGIES I USED:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

I am thinking of redoing the whole app at this point with Bootstrap.

TO DO:
1. FIX BUGS ;)
2. Memory
3. Dark mode
4. Menu
5. Scientific version
6. Graphic version
7. Programmers version
8. Date calculator
9. Converters

CREDTIS:
1. Windows calculator ;)
2. Fontawesome icons (They don't have every calculator icon, I had to drew some myself)
